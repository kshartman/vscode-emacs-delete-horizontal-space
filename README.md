# vscode-emacs-delete-horizontal-space README

This plugin provides a function which deletes all white space surrounding
point (.e. to the left and right) on the current line.  I usually bind this Alt+\ which conflicts
with trigger inline suggestion, so it does not bind a key.  You will need to 
do that.
